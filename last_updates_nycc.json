When Fleer finally abandoned its position, four players from across the country – businessmen who had met through tournaments and the online community – bonded together to purchase the company and reinvigorate the game. \n\nToday, they are currently producing new sets that include hot pop culture IPs like Skybound (e.g. The Walking Dead, Invincible), Top Cow (e.g. The Darkness, Witchblade, Cyberforce) and Edgar Rice Burroughs (e.g. Tarzan, John Carter), and utilizing the stellar artistry of comics superstars including Phillip Tan, Marc Silvestri, Joe Jusko, Jae Lee, Adam Kubert, Casey Parsons, Jon Lam, Ito and more.

The show kicks off with a nerdy stand-up set, followed by a journey through the history of a specific comic book character. Previous iterations of the show have chronicled the history of the Marvel Comics character Dazzler. We dive deep into their origins and evolution in the medium, all while enjoying engaging, live readings of comic book stories and panels. With support from Geeks Out, performances have been held at Caveat NYC and Flame Con. Comics Reading Comics is a hilarious blend of history, queerness, and geek culture—making it a must-see for comic and comedy lovers alike!\n\nPerformance video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ovKrQ_TmXaXyEwHlG6yfbaAq7T3_EHoI/view?usp=sharing",

    "description": "This year is the year to rise from the coffin with a special message for NYCC 2025! Horror is political and was conjured by the fear of the unknown. Although horror was introduced as a means of entertainment, it also served as a form of education. The message has stayed the same since its conception. However, as the horror genre evolved, it’s painfully evident that there is still much to be desired regarding representation. If marginalized voices created the horror genre, why is another demographic still disproportionately represented in these stories?\n\nThe concept of vampires has fascinated and terrified many, and it’s deeply rooted in many different cultures. Films and shows like Vamp, From Dusk Till Dawn, Blade, Queen of the Damned, Interview with the Vampire, and Sinners highlight people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals, signaling a gradual shift in the right direction. I reach out to you, fellow vampires, and those aspiring to be vampires. Step out of the tomb, fly here as either human or bat, or take the MTA (we don’t judge) and listen to us discuss the importance of representation. What does the future of horror hold, specifically for what vampires represent? We will come bearing gifts such as fresh blood, immortality, and giveaways, thanks to Vampire Freaks. So, as Akasha once said, \"My children, I have come to give you the world. Join me, or die.\"",
