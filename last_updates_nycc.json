Unlike most CCGs of its time, OverPower offered a distinctly different approach to strategy and structure. Though the game was discontinued at the height of its popularity in the late 2000s, pockets of players around the country kept it alive with local communities and regular tournaments. When Fleer finally abandoned its position, four players from across the country – businessmen who had met through tournaments and the online community – bonded together to purchase the company and reinvigorate the game. \n\nToday, they are currently producing new sets that include hot pop culture IPs like Skybound (e.g. The Walking Dead, Invincible), Top Cow (e.g. The Darkness, Witchblade, Cyberforce) and Edgar Rice Burroughs (e.g. Tarzan, John Carter), and utilizing the stellar artistry of comics superstars including Phillip Tan, Marc Silvestri, Joe Jusko, Jae Lee, Adam Kubert, Casey Parsons, Jon Lam, Ito and more. Come here the story of four self-proclaimed geeks – led by Lazarus Games Rising co-founders Ronald Pozzi &amp; Joseph Gagnepain – who met through their love of a fanboy property, and have come together to revive and help the CCG thrive with big plans.\n\nPublicist Gary Miereanu will moderate the panel",

Upon arrival, the group encounters enigmatic locals, peculiar rituals and sinister omens, leading Reema to suspect her aunt's untimely death was anything but accidental. As Reema delves into the island’s secrets, she discovers that her family’s past is intertwined with an ancient curse involving tantric rituals and forbidden practices. Haunted by visions and cryptic messages from her late mother, Reema must navigate a labyrinth of spiritual awakening, familial betrayal and moral dilemmas to emerge and morph into her true self. As tensions rise and the rituals grow perilous, Reema and her friends must confront their deepest fears to survive the island’s sinister grip. A psychological thriller steeped in Indian mysticism and dark magic, Mala will be discussed by a panel of cast members – led by Indigo Sabharwal (Curry Scent) as the title character, alongside Raw Leiba (The Walking Dead), Gisele George (The College Tour), Nikhil Kamkolkar (Love, Love) and Nehru Sabharwal – and filmmakers, including Nisha Sabharwal (Draupadi Unleashed), a multifaceted creative professional known for her work as an author, screenwriter, co-director and producer; and budding director Trishul Thejasvi (Greater Lakeland).\n\nPublicist Gary Miereanu will moderate the panel\n",

As Helen plots revenge and Madeline clings to her rapidly fading star, their world is suddenly turned upside down by Viola Van Horn, a mysterious woman with a secret that’s to die for.\n\nAfter one sip of Viola’s magical potion, Madeline and Helen begin a new era of life (and death) with their youth and beauty restored…and a grudge to last eternity.\n\nNow a warning! You may not be ready for the unbelievable amount of comedy, glamour, and magic onstage at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre. Death Becomes Her is a “wildly entertaining, perfect musical comedy. It grabs the audience by the jugular and doesn’t let go” (Deadline). Starring Tony nominees Megan Hilty, Jennifer Simard, and Christopher Sieber, plus Grammy® winner Michelle Williams, with direction and choreography by Tony winner Christopher Gattelli, Death Becomes Her is “a laugh-filled, tuneful musical to die for” (Variety) and “a cheek-aching laughter roller coaster — the most fun night out on Broadway!” (The Daily Beast). Experience the “savagely funny” (Time Out) pop-culture phenomenon that’s been certified “hilarious” by The New York Times, Entertainment Weekly, Z100, Beyoncé (!!), Goldie Hawn, Superman aka David Corenswet, Michelle Williams (the other one), and countless fans on Instagram, TikTok, and beyond.

Although horror was introduced as a means of entertainment, it also served as a form of education. The message has stayed the same since its conception. However, as the horror genre evolved, it’s painfully evident that there is still much to be desired regarding representation. If marginalized voices created the horror genre, why is another demographic still disproportionately represented in these stories?\n\nThe concept of vampires has fascinated and terrified many, and it’s deeply rooted in many different cultures. Films and shows like Vamp, From Dusk Till Dawn, Blade, Queen of the Damned, Interview with the Vampire, and Sinners highlight people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals, signaling a gradual shift in the right direction. I reach out to you, fellow vampires, and those aspiring to be vampires. Step out of the tomb, fly here as either human or bat, or take the MTA (we don’t judge) and listen to us discuss the importance of representation. What does the future of horror hold, specifically for what vampires represent? We will come bearing gifts such as fresh blood, immortality, and giveaways, thanks to Vampire Freaks. So, as Akasha once said, \"My children, I have come to give you the world. Join me, or die.\"",

I run an entire step team composed of geeks of different fandoms, otaku, cosplayers, and gamers.  \n\nThe workshop is open to all levels of steppers and people of all cultural backgrounds. We will learn about step and learn 1 step to music from/inspired by One Piece. Please dress comfortably with supportive footwear (if you will be engaging in the standing portions). Stepping requires movements such as stomping, clapping, and lifting our arms and legs. If you have a disability that restricts your movement we will modify those movements for you. Cosplay is encouraged/welcomed, but not mandatory. So come join Luffy and move to the beat of liberation!",
